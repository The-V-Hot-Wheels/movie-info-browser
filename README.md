# Movie Info Browser

As we explore which movie information API to use for our Challenge 6 project, we 
are finding that the IMDb API might be too cumbersome. The OMDb API seems to be 
much simpler.

Make sure you have your OMDb API key in an environment variable called 
`MOVIE_API_KEY`. Do not put your API key in any file in your Xcode project, even 
if it is a file excluded by the Git Ignore.
